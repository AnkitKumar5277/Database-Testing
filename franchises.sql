--  MySQL-Specific Syntax
-- Limit the number of rows returned, offset from the top with LIMIT m, n
select *
from franchises
limit 2,3;

--  By default, MySQL uses case insensitive matching in WHERE clauses
select * from franchises
where owner = 'the walt disney compnay';

--  To get case sensitive matching, use WHERE BINARY condn
select * from franchises
where binary owner = 'THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY';

--  Get the current date with CURDATE() and the current datetime with NOW() or CURTIME()
select curdate(), now(), curtime();

--  List available tables with show tables
